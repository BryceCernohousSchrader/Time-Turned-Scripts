# Time-Turned-Scripts
These are the scripts that were used to create Time Turned, a multi-year game project that has been published on Steam here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877110/Time_Turned/. Written in C#.

I assisted the development team and contributed to many of the scripts, among having other responsibilities as lead level designer. Below I have added some select example scripts in which I had major contributions to.

These are meant to be used as reference for assertaining if I meet your desired competency in architecting and programming for a large, multi-year project. The full Unity project has not been shared because that would allow for easy piracy. If you would like more information about where any of the scripts are used in the project or want to see parts of the Unity project, feel free to email me at brycecs2@comcast.net.

### Example Scripts
[PickUpObject.cs](Scripts/Atma%20Project/Pick%20Up%20Objects/Generic/PickUpObject.cs)
<br/>[PickupIndicatorBehavior.cs](Scripts/Atma%20Project/Pick%20Up%20Objects/Generic/PickupIndicatorBehavior.cs)
<br/>These scripts are related to picking up any items found within the game.<br/>
<br/>[GunBehavior.cs](Scripts/Atma%20Project/Pick%20Up%20Objects/GunBehavior.cs)
<br/>[ShieldBehavior.cs](Scripts/Atma%20Project/Pick%20Up%20Objects/ShieldBehavior.cs)
<br/>These scripts detail the capabilities of the Gun Item and Shield Item respectively.<br/>
