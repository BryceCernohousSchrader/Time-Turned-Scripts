# Time-Turned-Scripts
These are the scripts that were used to create Time Turned, a multi-year game project that has been published on Steam here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877110/Time_Turned/.

I assisted the development team and contributed to many of the scripts, among having other responsibilities.

These are meant to be used as reference for assertaining if I meet your desired competency in architecting and programming for a large, multi-year project. The full Unity project has not been shared because that would allow for easy piracy. If you would like more information about where any of the scripts are used in the project or want to see parts of the Unity project, feel free to email me at brycecs2@comcast.net.
